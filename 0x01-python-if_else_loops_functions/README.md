## 0x01. python - if/else, loops, functions
 
  This project introduces the concepts of the if/else condition, loops, and     functions in the Python programming language. All tasks are Python scrip    ts, except the last one, which is a C function and header, and is written     as a technical interview prep. The importing of modules are not allowed 
 for each task.

## 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

 file: ```0-positive_or_negative.py``` 
This Python program will assign a random signed number to the variable ``    `number``` each time it is executed, will print out that number and wheth    er it is positive or negative.
 
## 1. The last digit
file: ```1-last_digit.py```
 
This Python program will assign a random signed number to the variable ``    `number``` each time it is executed. It will then print out the number, i    ts last digit, and whether it's:
 - greater than 5
 - is 0
 - is less than 6 and not 0

## 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would     pay off
 file: ```3-print_alphabt.py```
 
This Python program prints the alphabet, in lowercase, except the letters     ```q``` and ```e```. Only one print function and one loop are allowed. C    haracters can't be stored in a variable, and modules are not allowed to b    e imported.
## 4. Hexadecimal printing
file: ```4-print_hexa.py```
 
This Python program prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hex    adecimal.
 
## 5. 00...99
file: ```5-print_comb2.py```
 
This Python program prints numbers from 0 to 99. Numbers are separated by     ```,``` followed by a space. Numbers are printed in ascedning order with     two digits, and the last number is followed by a new line. Only 2 ```pri    nt``` functions with string format are allowed, as well as one loop. Stor    ing numbers or strings in a variable, as well as importing modules, are n    ot allowed.
